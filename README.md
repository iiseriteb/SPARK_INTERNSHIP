# SPARK_INTERNSHIP

I have started a summer internship under Dr. Abhishek Samantray in the HSS Department at IIT Roorkee, as part of the SPARK Program. During this internship, my primary focus was on expanding the SEIR Model to the SEIRS Model, incorporating the dynamics of temporary immunity into epidemiological analysis. Additionally, I included Asymptomatic Compartments as they play a crucial role in the indirect transmission of diseases. To achieve this, I first formulated the differential equations representing the SEIRS Model and expressed them using R notation. These equations were then solved using the ODE function of the deSolve Package, considering specific initial values and parameter values. Furthermore, I visualized the results by generating graphs using ShinySIR.
