# SPARK_INTERNSHIP

I have completed a summer internship under [Dr. Abhishek Samantray](https://www.iitr.ac.in/~HS/Abhishek_Samantray) in the HSS Department at IIT Roorkee as part of the [SPARK](https://spark.iitr.ac.in/) Program. During this internship, my primary focus was on expanding the SEIR Model to the SEIRS Model, incorporating the dynamics of temporary immunity into epidemiological analysis. Additionally, I included Asymptomatic Compartments as they play a crucial role in the indirect transmission of diseases. To achieve this, I first formulated the differential equations representing the SEIRS Model and expressed them using R notation. These equations were then solved using the ODE function of the deSolve Package, considering specific initial values and parameter values. Furthermore, I visualized the results by generating graphs using ShinySIR.
